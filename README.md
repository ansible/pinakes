Pinakes is the upstream community project for RedHat's [Automation Services Catalog product.](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-services-catalog?hsLang=en-us)

Pinakes allows customers to expose their Ansible Job Templates and Workflows to business users with an added layer of governance. The Job Templates and Workflows are wrapped as Products into Portfolios which can be shared with different business users. An approval workflow can be attached to Products or Portfolios which adds governance and, in the future, will be able to notify the appropriate Administrators via email. Upon approval, the Job Template or workflow will be launched on the Automation Controller.

Pinakes in the future will also support editing of Survey Specs to create different flavors of the Job Template or Workflow with pre-canned parameters so businesss users don't have to be concerned about the details of a parameter.

For more information about our architecture and services we depend on, see the [architecture doc](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
